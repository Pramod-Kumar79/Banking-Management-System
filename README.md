# Banking-Management-System
This C++ project, developed for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) course, implements a comprehensive banking system using core DSA concepts. The application simulates real-world banking operations, leveraging a doubly linked list to maintain transaction histories, hash tables (unordered maps) for efficient account management, and queues to process pending transactions sequentially. File handling ensures persistent storage of account data, while encapsulation through well-defined classes maintains data integrity. The system demonstrates practical applications of DSA in finance, including algorithm efficiency for account searches, memory management via class destructors, and secure PIN-based authentication. Designed with a menu-driven interface, it serves as an academic yet industry-relevant implementation of banking operations, highlighting the importance of data structures in software development.
